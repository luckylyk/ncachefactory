BUGS:
    - timing calculation per frame, look fucked
    - strech check seems not working
    - fix persp cam doesn't seems working in batch cache
    - subprocess NEW_CONSOLE doesn't work under KDE/linux
    - fix workspace not well recognized
    - blast in mayapy doesn't support the ornaments. Force disabling the option in mayapy

BASIC CONFORT
    - Add play button, which allow really time (24f/s) sequence reading in the Multi cache monitor
    - Add values for wedging check before execute it
    - fix iterations count. that currently doesnt count first and last value.
      3 iteration == 5 caches, that sounds weird for artists
    - during interactive cache, if the cache is connection to the scene,
      it doesn't take interactively the frame cached after connection.
      Just force the all range in the ncache node to force the full range.

FEATURES
    - Add text in viewport for rendering (cache name and comment)
    - For mayapy caches, create a geometry text linked to the camera to fixe the issue.
    - Make the monitor support to receive new caches and remove some cache instead of recreating the widget everytime,
      losing the current caching viewport on each opening.
