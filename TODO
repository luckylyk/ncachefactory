mtodo list created from commit 60


BUGS:
  - timing calculation per frame, look fucked
  - fix slider click before first frame cached

  __ done __
  - Adapt geo text to cam ratio
  - unlock attributes before setAttr and relock if necessary: actually that was a namespace issue.
  - Fix apply settings
  - Fix set next frame on time slider which return to 0 instead of min slider value
  - Fix panel saved visibilities
  - fix slider time line after widget resizing
  - Fix the evil fr 150 start frame bug
  - Node table keep wrong icon in memory
  - fix workspace not well recognized
  - blast in mayapy doesn't support the ornaments. Force disabling the option in mayapy
  - subprocess NEW_CONSOLE doesn't work under KDE/linux
  - text on mayapy viewport is broken (more than unachieved)
  - fix persp cam doesn't seems working in batch cache:
    UPDATE: camera selection is now totally broken
  - stretch check seems not working
  - fix nhair connections


BASIC CONFORT
  - set sortable the cacheversions in the explorer panel
  - apply settings manage namespaces
  - have choice to apply settings only on selected nodes or all scene (all scene is currently default)

  __ done __
  - write cache name in cache monitor comparator
  - Add config system to allow external edit for custom configuration
  - Fix widget sizes
  - dock widget automatically on right panel
  - Add icons for attribute pick buttons
  - Save the playblast viewport options into maya preferences
  - no cache if mayapy path is wrong
  - set the cache button disable in batch cacher if no scene or attribute override are specified
  - set viewport batch text relative to focal
  - Add values for wedging check before execute it
  - fix iterations count. that currently doesnt count first and last value.
    3 iteration == 5 caches, that sounds weird for artists
  - allow to type manually the values to wedge
  - connect cache from monitor
  - during interactive cache, if the cache is connection to the scene,
    it doesn't take interactively the frame cached after connection.
    Just force the all range in the ncache node to force the full range.


MAIN FEATURES
  - blend attribute value button is still not implemented yet
  - play custom range in batch timeslider

  __ done __
  - Compare two batch rendering
  - Add play button, which allow really time (24f/s) sequence reading in the Multi cache monitor
  - For mayapy caches, create a geometry text linked to the camera to fixe the issue.
  - Add text in viewport for rendering (cache name and comment)
  - Make the monitor support to receive new caches and remove some cache
    instead of recreating the widget everytime,
    losing the current caching viewport on each opening.


ACCESIBILITY
  - Set tooltip on every qpushbutton
  - Remove pymel usage to optimise nCacheFactory loading
  - create HTML documentation

  __done__
  - Update readme with new features
