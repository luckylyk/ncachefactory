BASIC CONFORT
  - Multi switcher in the nodetableview toolbar have to skip the locked items
  - button to select connected cache/blend node (done but icon)
  - Add pipette button or callback to update automatically the workspace

  __ done __
  - Display creation and last modification date
  - Disable cache button in attribute wedging tabs, web options set aren't valid
  - set sortable the cacheversions in the explorer panel
  - rename properly the cache nodes to make blend edit easier

  - write cache name in cache monitor comparator
  - Add config system to allow external edit for custom configuration
  - Fix widget sizes
  - dock widget automatically on right panel
  - Add icons for attribute pick buttons
  - Save the playblast viewport options into maya preferences
  - no cache if mayapy path is wrong
  - set the cache button disable in batch cacher if no scene or attribute override are specified
  - set viewport batch text relative to focal
  - Add values for wedging check before execute it
  - fix iterations count. that currently doesnt count first and last value.
    3 iteration == 5 caches, that sounds weird for artists
  - allow to type manually the values to wedge
  - connect cache from monitor
  - during interactive cache, if the cache is connection to the scene,
    it doesn't take interactively the frame cached after connection.
    Just force the all range in the ncache node to force the full range.
