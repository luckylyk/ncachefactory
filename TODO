todo list created from commit 60

BUGS:
    - timing calculation per frame, look fucked
    - subprocess NEW_CONSOLE doesn't work under KDE/linux
    - blast in mayapy doesn't support the ornaments. Force disabling the option in mayapy

    __ done __
    - fix workspace not well recognized
    - text on mayapy viewport is broken (more than unachieved)
    - fix persp cam doesn't seems working in batch cache:
      UPDATE: camera selection is now totally broken
    - stretch check seems not working
    - fix nhair connections

BASIC CONFORT
    - set viewport batch text relative to focal
    - Add play button, which allow really time (24f/s) sequence reading in the Multi cache monitor
    - Save the playblast viewport options

    __ done __
    - Add values for wedging check before execute it
    - fix iterations count. that currently doesnt count first and last value.
      3 iteration == 5 caches, that sounds weird for artists
    - allow to type manually the values to wedge
    - connect cache from monitor
    - during interactive cache, if the cache is connection to the scene,
      it doesn't take interactively the frame cached after connection.
      Just force the all range in the ncache node to force the full range.

MAIN FEATURES
    - Add text in viewport for rendering (cache name and comment)
    - For mayapy caches, create a geometry text linked to the camera to fixe the issue.
    - Make the monitor support to receive new caches and remove some cache
      instead of recreating the widget everytime,
      losing the current caching viewport on each opening.
