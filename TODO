  - Fix the evil fr 150 start frame bug
  - Node table keep wrong icon in memory
  - fix workspace not well recognized
  - blast in mayapy doesn't support the ornaments. Force disabling the option in mayapy
  - subprocess NEW_CONSOLE doesn't work under KDE/linux

BASIC CONFORT
  - set sortable the cacheversions in the explorer panel

  __ done __
  - Fix sizes
  - dock widget automatically on right panel
  - Add icons for attribute pick buttons
  - Save the playblast viewport options into maya preferences
  - no cache if mayapy path is wrong
  - set the cache button disable in batch cacher if no scene or attribute override are specified
  - set viewport batch text relative to focal
  - Add values for wedging check before execute it
  - fix iterations count. that currently doesnt count first and last value.
    3 iteration == 5 caches, that sounds weird for artists
  - allow to type manually the values to wedge
  - connect cache from monitor
  - during interactive cache, if the cache is connection to the scene,
    it doesn't take interactively the frame cached after connection.
    Just force the all range in the ncache node to force the full range.


MAIN FEATURES
  - Add play button, which allow really time (24f/s) sequence reading in the Multi cache monitor
  - blend attribute value button is still not implemented

  __ done __
  - For mayapy caches, create a geometry text linked to the camera to fixe the issue.
  - Add text in viewport for rendering (cache name and comment)
  - Make the monitor support to receive new caches and remove some cache
    instead of recreating the widget everytime,
    losing the current caching viewport on each opening.


ACCESIBILITY
  - Set tooltip on every qpushbutton
  - Update readme with new features
  - Remove pymel usage to optimise nCacheFactory loading
  - create HTML documentation
